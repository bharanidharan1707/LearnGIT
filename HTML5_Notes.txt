=>DOCTYPE - Document Type Definition tells browsers and validators what version of HTML the page is written in.
Ex: HTML 4 - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" ..... > 

=>Charset - character encoding instructs browsers and validators what set of characters to use when rendering web page.
EX: HTML 4 - <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;" charset="UTF-8"/>

If a character set is declared neither in the document nor in the response headers, the
browser might choose one for you, and it may be the wrong one for your site’s needs.

=>lang - Browsers, screen readers, and other user agents use the lang attribute to determine the
language in which the content should be interpreted.

=>Document Structure

header
Is used to contain the headline(s) for a page and/or section. It can also contain
supplemental information such as logos and navigational aids.

footer
Contains information about a page and/or section, such as who wrote it, links to
related information, and copyright statements.

nav
Contains the major navigation links for a page and, while not a requirement, is
often contained by header.

aside
Contains information that is related to the surrounding content but also exists
independently, such as a sidebar or pull-quotes.

section
Is the most generic of the new structural elements, containing content that can be
grouped thematically or is related.

article
Is used for self-contained content that could be consumed independently of the
page as a whole, such as a blog entry.


=> Emphasizing Text
Contain the text to be emphasized with the em element.
New: <p> This an <em> example </em> </p>
Old: <p> This an <i> example </i> </p>

=> Bold text
Contain the text with strong element.
New: <p> This an <strong> example </strong> </p>
Old: <p> This an <b> example </b> </p>

=> Highlighting Text
Highlight the search item in a list of search results.
<p> Found search value here <mark> Value retrieved </mark> </p>

=>Acronyms and abbreviation
Contain the abbreviation or acronym with abbr
<abbr title="Internet Information Service">IIS</abbr>

=> Adding links to block level content
Contain both the logo image and the heading with the a element:
<a href="http://html5funprofit.com">
<h1>HTML5, for Fun &amp; Profit</h1>
<img src="logo.png" alt="HTML5 for Fun and Profit" />
</a>

old:
<h1><a href="http://html5funprofit.com">HTML5, for Fun &amp; Profit</a></h1>
<a href="http://html5funprofit.com"><img src="logo.png" alt="HTML5 for Fun and
Profit" /></a>
 
=> Marking up dates and times

To encode date-time content for machines, but still retain human readability.

<time datetime="2011-01-15">January 15, 2011</time></p>

One limitation of time that is worth mentioning is that it can’t be used
for imprecise dates, such as “August 2011.” It does require, minimally,
the day, month, and year for dates.

===>pubdate

Adding this attribute indicates that the time is the actual publication date-time for a web page
or an article (such as a blog post) on a page.

<time datetime="2011-01-09" pubdate>January 9, 2011</time></p>

=> Setting the stage for expanding and collapsing

To provide content that can expand and collapse with user focus.

Ex:
<details>
<summary>Upcoming Topics</summary>
<p>For the new year, we have a great line up of articles!</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the Outline Algorithm</li>
<li>When to Use <code>hgroup</code></li>
<li>Machine Semantics with Microdata</li>
</ul>
</details>

=> Controlling the numbering of list

===> "start" attribute
To start a numbered list at 3.

<ol start="3">
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
<li>Bananas</li>
</ol>

===> "reversed" attribute
reverses the order of a list
<ol reversed>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
<li>Bananas</li>
</ol>

===> "value" attribute
specify the exact number value for each li.
<ol>
<li value="1">Bananas</li>
<li value="1">Oranges</li>
<li value="2">Apples</li>
</ol>

=> Making portions of the page editable
To allow users to directly edit content in the browser.

<article contenteditable>
<h2>Stop <code>section</code> Abuse!</h2>
<p>As the most generic of the HTML5 structural elements, <code>section</code>
is often incorrectly used as a styling container, when <code>div</code> is
more appropriate.</p>
</article>

/* Important */

=>Modernizr

Unfortunately, HTML5 currently comes with limited browser support. You might like
to implement some of these new technologies, but you also want to accommodate
browsers that don’t yet support them.

It detects the availability of various HTML5 and CSS3 features within a
user’s browser and allows you to create fallbacks when a desired feature isn’t currently
supported.

Include in web page
<script src="js/modernizr-1.6.min.js"></script>

Add below script section

<script>
if (Modernizr.audio) {
function playPause() {
var myAudio = document.getElementsByTagName('audio')[0];
if(myAudio.paused)
myAudio.play();
else
myAudio.pause();
}
}
</script>


/* Forms */

=> Displaying search input field

<form>
<p><label>Search <input type="search" name="query"></label></p>
<p><button type="submit">Submit</button></p>
</form>

=> Contact information input fields

To present a user with a form to provide contact information

<form>
<fieldset>
<legend>Contact Information</legend>
<p><label>E-mail address <input type="email" name="email"></label></p>
<p><label>Web site <input type="url" name="website"></label></p>
<p><label>Telephone number <input type="tel" name="phone"></label></p>
</fieldset>
<p><button type="submit">Submit</button></p>
</form>
