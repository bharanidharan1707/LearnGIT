=>DOCTYPE - Document Type Definition tells browsers and validators what version of HTML the page is written in.
Ex: HTML 4 - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" ..... > 

=>Charset - character encoding instructs browsers and validators what set of characters to use when rendering web page.
EX: HTML 4 - <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;" charset="UTF-8"/>

If a character set is declared neither in the document nor in the response headers, the
browser might choose one for you, and it may be the wrong one for your site’s needs.

=>lang - Browsers, screen readers, and other user agents use the lang attribute to determine the
language in which the content should be interpreted.
